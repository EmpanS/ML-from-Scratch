# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This is just-for-fun project where I implement different machine learning algorithms from scratch. A while ago, I decided to start implementing machine learning algorithms to get a better understanding of how they work. See each specific folder for how to run the algorithms.

## Content
This project currently contains the following:
1. An implementation of the k-means algorithm: [kMeans](https://github.com/EmpanS/ML-from-Scratch/tree/master/kMeans)

## Further implementations that I would like to do:
1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
2. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)


Any comments, suggestions or feedback is heavily appreciated. Thanks and happy training!
